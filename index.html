<h1> Cholera's journey across the world </h1>
<p>Historical cases show that there have been no cases of cholera in Haiti since the 1800s, but in October 2010, Haitians living less than two miles from a UN camp began dying of the disease.</p>
<p>Since then, scientific studies, video documentation and Haitians have come forward with evidence to substantiate the claim that the UN introduced the disease to earthquake-ravaged Haiti.</p>
<p>I would like to make a data visualization of cholera's journey, from an outbreak in mid-west Nepal, to the capital, Kathmandu, up on board a 40-hour flight that stopped in Karachi, the Azores and then in Haiti where it fanned out from Mirebalais in the Central district to the Artibonite area and then the rest of Haiti. I would also like to show that it has since moved to the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Florida. The story is newsworthy because cholera has reached the shores of Florida and 70,000 Cuban Americans visited the US last year and on Aug 20 this year, the US issues a health advisory warning against travel to Cuba, yet cholera vaccines are not available throughout the US.</p>

<h1>Cholera in the world</h1>
<p>I would like to make a data visualization of how many people across the globe die because of cholera every year. There are an estimated 3-5 milion cholera cases and 120,000 deaths due to cholera every year. I would also like to include the estimated cost of vaccinating at-risk populations and the estimated cost of treating these populations in the illustration.</p>
