<h1> Cholera in Haiti and the International Cover-up </h1>

</head>
<body>
<p>Historical cases show that there have been no cases of cholera in Haiti since the 1800s, but in October 2010, Haitians living less than two miles from a UN camp began dying of the disease.</p>
<p>Since then, scientific studies, video documentation and Haitians have come forward with evidence to substantiate the claim that the UN introduced the disease to earthquake-ravaged Haiti.</p>
<p>I would like to make a data visualization of cholera's journey, from an outbreak in mid-west Nepal, to the capital, Kathmandu, up on board a 40-hour flight that stopped in Karachi, the Azores and then in Haiti where it fanned out. It has since moved to the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Florida.</p>
