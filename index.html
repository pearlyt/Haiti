<h1> Cholera's journey across the world </h1>
<p>Historical cases show that there have been no cases of cholera in Haiti since the 1800s, but in October 2010, Haitians living less than two miles from UN military camp housing Nepalese troops began dying of the disease.</p>

<p>Since then, scientific studies, video documentation and Haitians have come forward with evidence to substantiate the claim that the UN introduced the disease to earthquake-ravaged Haiti.</p>

<p>I would like to make a 2D/3D map data visualization of cholera's journey, from an outbreak in mid-west Nepal, to the capital, Kathmandu, up on board a 40-hour flight that stopped in Karachi, the Azores (via confidential source) and then in Haiti where it fanned out from Mirebalais in the Central district to the Artibonite area and then the rest of Haiti. I would also like to show that it has since caused outbreaks in the Dominican Republic, Cuba (Summer 2012 after a 100 year absence) and Mexico (October 23, 2013).</p>

<p>The story is newsworthy because vacationers have brought cholera to Chile, Venezuela, Italy, Germany, Holland and even Florida, and all it takes is for one restauranteur and poor hygiene habits for an outbreak to happen (cases in Cuba and Mexico have been traced to restaurants), even with access to clean water. It is also notable that cholera vaccines are not available throughout the US. With 70,000 Cuban Americans visiting Cuba in 2012 and a high number of documented and undocumented Mexicans moving and out of the US, this country is certainly not immune from experiencing an outbreak.</p>
